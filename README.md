<h1>MEOWSER EXPERIMENT: #0001: Playing w/Java & Colors</h1> 

<h3>DESCRIPTION:</h3> 

A (not so) simple color change exploration for Java console. To run [click here](https://replit.com/@meowser/ColorsDukeOne).
<br>

**At this moment, this REPL prints ANSI colors with their color codes for Java console.**

<hr>

<h3>FUTURE-ish UPDATES</h3>

- Create method to call colors from ConsoleColors.java
- Add Displayed list for:
  - bold colors
  - underline colors
  - background colors^
  - high intensity colors
  - bold high intensity colors
  - high intensity backgrounds^^ 

<h3>GOAL(S):</h3>

- To take what I learn and place it into a simple text RPG ... someday.
- To practice coding in a way that's fun, helps me grow my skills, and provides a break from the main programming stuff I'm learning. 

<h3>QUESTIONS TO EXPLORE</h3> 


- ~~Can I add color to README files in Replit's markdown setup?~~
  - No. As for as I know Replit does not allow it.
<br><br>
- Can I figure out how to create a simple program that let's users select and save a color preference?
<br><br>
- Can I figure out how to create a simple program that changes color based on a user's time zone?
<br><br>
- Can I figure out how to create a simple program that displays characters in a rainbow spectrum?
  - How about ombre/gradient tones?
  - How about grayscale?
  - What about instead of every character every...
    - word
    - three words
    - paragraph
    - after so many periods
    - after so many of the same vowels (every 4 a's)
  
<br>

- Can I change the background color of the console(might make that its own seperate project).
<br><br>
- Can I figure out how to keep things nice and simple and tidy over messy but it works?
  - In other words can I balance learning how to make things happen with also learning good coding hygiene.
  - I get lost sometimes in over documenting in general (*deep sighs*).
<br><br>
- **META** Even if I figure out how to do the above can I understand and breakdown my own code to a stranger in a way it makes sense?
